                'description': '''# Mastering the Art of Sourdough Bread

Sourdough bread making is both an art and a science. With patience and practice, you can create bakery-quality loaves at home.

## Getting Started

### Creating Your Starter
1. Mix equal parts flour and water
2. Feed daily for 7-10 days
3. Look for bubbles and sour smell
4. Store in refrigerator when active

### Essential Equipment
- Digital kitchen scale
- Dutch oven or bread pan
- Bench scraper
- Proofing basket (banneton)

## The Process

### Day 1: Autolyse
- Mix flour and water
- Let rest for 30-60 minutes
- This develops gluten naturally

### Day 1: Mixing
- Add starter and salt
- Mix until smooth
- Perform stretch and folds

### Day 1: Bulk Fermentation
- Let rise for 4-6 hours
- Perform folds every 30 minutes
- Watch for 50% volume increase

### Day 2: Shaping and Baking
- Shape into boule or batard
- Proof for 2-4 hours
- Bake at 450Â°F for 30 minutes

## Troubleshooting

**Dense bread**: Under-proofed or weak starter
**Too sour**: Over-fermented or old starter
**Flat loaf**: Over-proofed or weak gluten

## Conclusion

Perfect sourdough takes time to master. Don't be discouraged by early failures - each loaf teaches you something new!''',
